# Module #14: Azure RateCard REST API

In this module you will learn how to use the RateCard API, one of the two endpoints in the Azure Billing API. This API allows developers to get access to all pricing information for all Azure resources, including the detailed tiered pricing. While the Azure Billing REST API is not part of the Partner Center SDK, just like the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) APIs covered in another module, this is an important API that you should be aware of for use in your applications.
