# CSP - Partner Center SDK Course

This course is for Microsoft partners who are in the **[Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/pages/solutions/cloud-reseller-overview.aspx)** program and who are interested in the **Partner Center SDK**, including both the managed API and REST API. This includes partners who have been using the initial CREST API.

The course consists of multiple lectures and demos that are roughly 45-60 minutes in duration, each comprised of a module. It also includes a number of self-paced hands-on-labs for course participants.

Pre-requisites for the course are that the viewer already has experience as a developer, and they should have prior familiarity with the REST protocol. During the training a viewer will learn about using the Partner Center SDK for a variety of scenarios such that they can implement integration of sales and billing systems for a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider partner.

## Modules - Lectures & Demos

1. **[Introductory System Concepts and Getting Started with the Partner Center SDK](mod-01-overview)**

  This module provides an overview for the course. We will talk about key concepts and the technical actors involved in the Partner Center SDK.

It will teach how to use Partner Center REST API calls in the same application as CREST API calls and how to manage authentication. And it will show demos of working in a console application that calls CREST and the Partner Center REST APIs.

1. **[REST and JSON Primer & Debugging API Calls](mod-04-rest)**

  This module describes REST and JSON since those are the protocols that the Partner Center SDK uses to communicate with Microsoft. Whether you are programming at the REST layer or using the Partner Center SDK, it’s really valuable to be able to see what's happening on the wire. This module covers these core protocols and also shows how to code against the REST APIs and how to debug with them.

1. **[Getting Started with the Sample Code](mod-05-samplecode)**

  This module shows how to obtain and compile and use the three sample applications. It shows the CREST sample code. It shows the Partner Center SDK sample console application. And it shows the Partner Center SDK sample web application.

1. **[Managing Customers](mod-06-customers)**

  This module walks through various scenarios for working with customer records in the Partner Center SDK. This includes getting a partner's customers, creating customers, deleting customers, getting a customer profile, managing customers, and getting a customer subscriptions and orders.

  This module provides an overview of Azure subscriptions from the Partner Center SDK. It shows how to create Azure subscriptions in the Partner Center SDK, and also how to add users to those subscriptions. It also shows how to use Azure Resource Manager to add Azure resources to the subscription.

1. **[Managing Support Tickets](mod-10-support)**

  This module provides an overview of a partners access to both partner and customer service requests through the Partner Center SDK. This includes searching and updating service requests. It also shows how to create service requests through the SDK.

1. **[Admin on Behalf of (AOBO)](mod-11-aobo)**

  Admin on behalf of (AOBO) is where an application created by the partner and registered in the Partner’s Azure AD tenant that can perform administrative tasks on the customer’s Azure AD tenant on behalf of the customer. For Office 365 this simply means that the partner can log in as themselves and have administrative access to their customers Office 365 tenant. This module describes how this works for Office 365 and for Microsoft Azure.

1. **[Office Subscription Transitions](mod-12-o365transition)**

  This module talks about how an Office 365 customer can transition their subscription to a new Office 365 offer. It shows you how to use the Partner Center SDK to list the available subscription offers that a customer can move to, and how to submit the request.

1. **[Reviewing Azure Usage Information](mod-13-usage)**

  This module describes the new Rated Usage feature available in the Partner Center SDK. It shows how to utilize the new customer spending budget which provides an email notification to the partner.
