# Module #4: REST + JSON Primer & Debugging API Calls

This module describes REST and JSON since those are the protocols that the Partner Center SDK uses to communicate with Microsoft. Whether you are programming at the REST layer or using the Partner Center SDK, it’s really valuable to be able to see what's happening on the wire. This module covers these core protocols and also shows how to code against the REST APIs and how to debug with them.
